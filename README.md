# Fine-Tune LLMs and Build Your Application

This project focuses on fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrating them into an AI-powered application using **Hugging Face, LangChain, Astra DB, and FastAPI**. The implementation is done using **Google Colab** and tracked via **GitHub Projects**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Fine-tuning **LLaMA 2 & Mistral 7B** models
- Using **Astra DB** for vector storage
- **LangChain** for AI application integration
- Building an **API with FastAPI**
- Deployment via **Hugging Face Spaces**
